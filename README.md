This theme is entirely built out of ooMox<br />
You can find ooMox here https://github.com/themix-project/oomox and the rest is the theme I generated with it and basically a "recommendation" for comfortable viewing and part of the overall project of putting together a desktop like mine.<br /><br />
This is the icon set that was generated with ooMox also https://github.com/itskrystibitch/KrystiKandi-icons
